## PersonasOnto - Ontology

The PersonasOnto is depicts the personas domain along with relating concept and properties. A persona is regarded as a user archetype which can be used to "help guide decisions about product features, navigation, interactions, and even visual design" (Goodwin, 2005).

This ontology wants to address some of the issues regarding this methodology like how personas are reconciled with other information and who is responsible for interpreting and validating them.
